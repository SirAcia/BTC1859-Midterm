# It is perceived that patients with liver transplant have problems with sleep. 
# In addition, it is hypothesized that sleep disturbance has a direct effect on Quality of Life. 

# The objective of this project is the investigation of these hypotheses with 
# the use of an observational dataset of 268 patients with liver transplant.
